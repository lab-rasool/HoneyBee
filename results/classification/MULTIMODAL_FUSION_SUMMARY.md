# Multimodal Fusion Classification Results Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and tested three multimodal fusion methods for cancer classification:
1. **Concatenation (CONCAT)** - Concatenates embeddings from all modalities with zero-padding for missing ones
2. **Mean Pooling (MEAN_POOL)** - Averages embeddings across modalities
3. **Kronecker Product (KP)** - Creates pairwise interactions between modalities

## Key Results

### Fusion Method Performance
| Method | Accuracy | F1-Score | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **CONCAT** | **0.8979 (±0.0042)** | **0.8954 (±0.0045)** | **Best performing** |
| KP | 0.8952 (±0.0053) | 0.8925 (±0.0056) | Close second |
| MEAN_POOL | 0.7071 (±0.0092) | 0.6917 (±0.0091) | Lowest performance |

### Individual Modality Performance
| Modality | Accuracy | F1-Score |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Clinical | 0.8858 (±0.0063) | 0.8833 (±0.0065) |
| Molecular | 0.5673 (±0.0079) | 0.5573 (±0.0072) |
| Radiology | 0.4778 (±0.0351) | 0.4411 (±0.0301) |
| Pathology | 0.4445 (±0.0080) | 0.4166 (±0.0081) |
| WSI | 0.2841 (±0.0082) | 0.2483 (±0.0079) |

## Key Findings

1. **Concatenation performs best** - The simple concatenation approach with zero-padding for missing modalities achieves the highest accuracy (89.79%)

2. **Multimodal outperforms single modalities** - Both CONCAT and KP fusion methods perform better than any individual modality, including clinical (88.58%)

3. **Mean pooling underperforms** - At 70.71% accuracy, mean pooling performs worse than clinical alone, likely due to information loss from averaging

4. **Patient coverage varies** - Most common combination is clinical+pathology+molecular+WSI (6,939 patients), with 950 patients having all 5 modalities

## Technical Implementation

### Fusion Methods Details

#### Concatenation
- Concatenates embeddings from available modalities
- Pads with zeros for missing modalities to ensure consistent dimension
- Final dimension: 4,120 (sum of all modality dimensions)

#### Mean Pooling  
- Projects all embeddings to common dimension (1,024)
- Averages across modalities
- Handles missing modalities with zero-padding

#### Kronecker Product
- Creates pairwise interactions between modalities
- Samples 100 interactions per modality pair
- Final dimension: 4,912 (original features + interactions)

## Confusion Matrix Analysis

### Performance Metrics by Fusion Method
| Method | Accuracy | Mean Precision | Mean Recall | Mean F1-Score |
|--------|----------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Concatenation | 0.8929 | 0.9135 (±0.0713) | 0.8471 (±0.1624) | 0.8686 (±0.1134) |
| Kronecker Product | 0.8938 | 0.9188 (±0.0818) | 0.8524 (±0.1539) | 0.8740 (±0.1087) |
| Mean Pooling | 0.6950 | 0.7320 (±0.2137) | 0.5960 (±0.2755) | 0.6154 (±0.2465) |

### Key Observations from Confusion Matrices

1. **Best Performing Cancer Types** (across all methods):
   - LAML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) - Perfect classification in CONCAT and MEAN_POOL
   - KICH (Kidney Chromophobe) - Perfect classification in KP
   - PCPG, THYM, UCS - Consistently high performance

2. **Challenging Cancer Types**:
   - READ (Rectum Adenocarcinoma) - Lowest F1 scores in CONCAT (0.531) and KP (0.542)
   - CHOL (Cholangiocarcinoma) - Low performance across all methods
   - ACC (Adrenocortical Carcinoma) - Poor performance, especially in mean pooling

3. **Method-Specific Insights**:
   - **Concatenation**: Most balanced performance with fewer extreme failures
   - **KP**: Slightly better precision but similar overall performance to concatenation
   - **Mean Pooling**: Significantly worse, with many cancer types having <50% recall

### Visualizations Generated
1. Individual confusion matrices for each fusion method
2. Side-by-side comparison of all three methods
3. Cancer type performance heatmap across methods
4. Modality presence analysis

## Recommendations

1. **Use concatenation fusion** for production deployments due to best performance and simplicity
2. **Consider KP fusion** for research applications where feature interactions are of interest
3. **Avoid mean pooling** for this application as it loses too much information
4. **Focus on data collection** to increase the number of patients with all modalities available
5. **Special attention needed** for READ, CHOL, and ACC cancer types which show poor classification across all methods
