# Plan for Whole Slide Image (WSI) Processing Example Showcases
This document outlines the plan for creating example showcases that demonstrate the capabilities of the WSI processing library. The examples will cover various aspects of WSI loading, tissue detection, segmentation, stain normalization, stain separation, and embedding generation. The showcase should be designed to highlight the library's features, performance, and ease of use. Each example will include code snippets, explanations, and visualizations where applicable.

The key areas of focus for the examples are:
1. **WSI Loading and Data Management**: Demonstrating the library's ability to load and manage whole slide images efficiently, including support for various file formats and metadata handling.
2. **Tissue Detection and Segmentation**: Showcasing different methods for detecting and segmenting tissue regions within whole slide images, including classical and deep learning-based approaches.
3. **Stain Normalization**: Illustrating the normalization of stain variations across different whole slide images to ensure consistent color representation.
4. **Stain Separation**: Demonstrating the separation of different stain components within whole slide images, allowing for detailed analysis of tissue structures.
5. **Embedding Generation**: Showcasing the generation of embeddings from whole slide images for downstream tasks such as classification, segmentation, and clustering.
6. **Downstream Tasks**: Highlighting how the generated embeddings can be used for various downstream tasks, including classification and clustering of tissue regions.

# WSI Loading and Data Management 

HoneyBee Supports the following:

- Aperio SVS format
- Philips TIFF format
- Generic tiled multi-resolution RGB TIFF files
- Multiple compression schemes (JPEG, JPEG2000, LZW, Deflate)

Performance Features

- GPU-accelerated I/O through CUDA using CuImage
- NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage support for direct storage-to-GPU data transfer
- Fast loading of specific regions of interest
- Automatic memory management with caching strategies
- On-demand loading of specific regions at desired resolution levels

## Metadata Handling
- Physical spacing information preservation (in micrometers)
- Coordinate system specifications
- Vendor-specific metadata (objective magnification, microns-per-pixel ratios)
- ICC color profile preservation for Aperio SVS files
- Detailed scan parameter retention

## Multi-Resolution Management
- Efficient access to WSI data at different magnification levels
- Resolution information maintenance (dimensions, downsampling factors, tile specifications)
- Support for both CPU and GPU memory targets
- Coordinate consistency across resolution levels
- Base-resolution coordinate specification for any pyramid level access

# Tissue Detection and Segmentation

## Detection Methods
1. Classical Threshold-Based Method
   - Otsu's algorithm implementation
   - Automatic threshold determination
   - Gradient magnitude map generation
   - Binary tissue mask creation
   - Computationally efficient for good contrast images
2. Deep Learning-Based Method
   - Pretrained DenseNet Slidl model
   - Three-way classification (tissue, background, noise)
   - Artifact detection (pen markings, etc.)
   - More robust tissue detection capabilities

## Patch Extraction
- Grid-based patch extraction from detected tissue regions
- Configurable patch sizes (typically 256×256 or 512×512 pixels)
- Tissue content threshold filtering
- Coordinate maintenance relative to original WSI
- Maximized coverage of relevant tissue regions
- Efficient memory loading for scalable processing

# Stain Normalization

## Three Normalization Methods
1. Reinhard Normalization
   - LAB color space statistical matching
   - Computationally efficient
   - Color property matching between source and target images
2. Macenko Normalization
   - Stain vector estimation via singular value decomposition
   - Optical density space processing
   - Hematoxylin and eosin contribution separation
   - Relative staining pattern preservation
3. Vahadane Normalization
   - Sparse non-negative matrix factorization
   - Robust stain separation
   - Handles varying tissue characteristics
   - Works with additional stain presence

# Stain Separation

## Color Deconvolution
- Beer-Lambert law-based decomposition
- RGB to HED (Hematoxylin-Eosin-DAB) color space conversion
- Calibrated deconvolution matrices
- Characteristic absorption spectra accounting

## Component Analysis
- Hematoxylin component: Nuclear structure highlighting
- Eosin component: Cytoplasmic and stromal feature emphasis
- DAB component: Immunohistochemical signal isolation

## Conversion Capabilities
- Bidirectional RGB-HED conversion
- Separated stain channel analysis
- Reconstructed normalized image generation
- Modified stain characteristic application
- GPU-accelerated operations
- Automated tiling for large image regions

Provide all the code into the following folder: /mnt/f/Projects/HoneyBee/examples/wsi if testing is needed to check something then make use of the following folder to limit clutter: /mnt/f/Projects/HoneyBee/examples/wsi/tmp/

Take as long as you need to complete the examples, but try to keep them concise and focused on the key features of the library. Each example should be self-contained and easy to understand, with clear explanations of the code and its purpose. Also test and make sure everything works as expected before finalizing the examples.
